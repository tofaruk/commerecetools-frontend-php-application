# Raw to advance php
I will try implement different topics in this project. There will be different git branches for each topics. Everything should be merged in master branch which is working. 

Epic branches will have  more than one branch to check are they working together or not. Remember every time you switch the branch maybe need to run composer install command.  

#### Start the server 
Run this command in project directory `php -S localhost:8080 -t public/`

## Tips 
* `composer dump-autoload -o` to generate autoloader
